# Power BI Performance Report Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on the creation of an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze the performance of a company across various metrics, including **Gross Profit**, **Sales**, **Profitability**, and **Year-to-Date (YTD) Comparisons**. The objective is to provide a clear, concise, and insightful visual representation of key business metrics to aid decision-makers in monitoring and optimizing company performance.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Power BI Desktop** – Used for building the interactive report and data visualization.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – Implemented for creating dynamic measures, including YTD vs Prior YTD comparisons.
- **Data Modeling** – Ensured efficient relationships between tables for seamless data aggregation.
- **Conditional Formatting** – Applied to highlight important trends and performance indicators.
- **Slicers** – Added for interactive filtering by region, account, and performance metrics.
- **Report Layout Optimization** – Focused on making the dashboard user-friendly with an emphasis on clarity and readability.

## Key Features
- **Interactive Filters**: Users can filter performance data by region and account using slicers for dynamic insights.
- **Dynamic Calculations**: Leveraged DAX to create dynamic calculations like YTD vs Prior YTD to compare performance across different time periods.
- **Conditional Formatting**: Applied to highlight key performance trends such as profitability and gross profit, making it easier for users to spot underperforming areas.
- **Year-to-Date vs Prior YTD**: Visualizes performance over time with a focus on year-to-date comparisons for tracking progress.

## Report Insights
This dashboard provides valuable insights such as:
- Performance trends over multiple years.
- Key metrics like gross profit and profitability at a glance.
- Comparisons of year-to-date performance against prior years, allowing for better decision-making.
- Underperforming areas, enabling targeted actions to drive improvements.
